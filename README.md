# Java Games from 2018

This repository serves as a **time capsule** for some of my earliest Java game projects, developed in 2018. The goal was simple: to put basic programming concepts into practice while learning about logic and interactive development.

### The Projects

You'll find the following games here:

* **Mario:** A simple recreation inspired by the classic universe.
* **Minecraft_fake:** A basic 2D version inspired by Minecraft's building mechanics.

To execute the program, just compile the `src/main.java file`

### Note on Development

The code in this repository does **not reflect modern software development best practices**, as it was written by a beginner many years ago. Its main value is historical and sentimental, marking the start of my journey into the world of programming.
